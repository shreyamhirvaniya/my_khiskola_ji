    <h1>"He's just a man?"
Nah, but that's where you're wrong....
He's not just a man, he's so much more,
A kind heart, a loving soul, and a gentle roar.
His smile lights up my day,✨️
His touch shows me a loving way.🫳🏻
He's a treasure, a precious find,
A love that's rare, and one of a kind.
He's my rock, my guiding light,
My forever love, my shining star in the night.
So don't say he's just a man,
He's the love of my life, my master plan & My MAN😁🥰
