                "i love you" means that i accept you for who you are, all your insecurities; what you see as imperfections and i see simply as parts of you that make you yourself. it means that i won't try to change you into someone different, it means that i will always care for you and be there for you no matter what comes in between us. ðŸ˜Œ it means i'll stand by you and love you through the worst of times. That means loving you in a bad mood, when you're down, it means loving you and supporting you when you're too tired to do the things i want to do. it means me putting you before myself or anyone else. it means loving you all of the time. "i love you" means you can tell me anything if you ever want to and i'll always listen and never judge you. ðŸ’• all ask in return is that you don't judge me for the things i tell you. it means that i care enough to fight for you and hold you and never let go. it means i'm always thinking of you, dreaming of you, wishing could be with you when i'm not. "i love you" to me, is the connection between two people's hearts, beauty, personalities, and soul. it means we are intertwined into each others paths. it means that i'm not only in "this" for a sexual way, or a physical way. i'm in "this" [relationship] for all of you, everything you do and feel. it means there's a deeper connection that anyone else wouldn't be able to comprehend. it means always needing you or wanting you, knowing that you feel the same way towards me and trusting you to feel similarly. there is more to "i love you" than i can describe in words other than the words i'm describing, "i love you".    and btw aa pic ma cute lago tame ðŸ’•
