When I first met you on April 15 I can't forget that day. Woh khet me aapka mansi didi ka shoot karna .mera sabse late aana aapki najar mujpe girna 😇 .aapko humse pehli najar ka pyar hona ( i don't aapko kaise hu but hua ) fir shoot k last din aapka mujhe bye bolke ghar vapis jana .( on April 18 ) hamri baat shuru hona( on 23 April ) aur dusre hi din yani 24 April ko mujhe prapose karna hamara first time call  mujhe kesa ladka chahiye aapke mutabik pyar kya hai mujhe kesa ladka deserve karta hai woh baate😊 to be honest jab aapne bola ki aapko mujse love at first site hua tab bilkul yakeen nahi hua tha ki mujse bhi koi pyaar kar sakta hai woh bhi pehli nazar ka nd mujhe aaj tak samaj nai aaya ki kaise hua yeh  kyuki na toh uss din maine kuch khas makeup kiya na hi itni achi lag rahi thi toh aapne uss vakht kya dekh kar mujse pyar hua nd mujhe ye abhi tak samaj nahi aaya ki pehli najar ka pyar kaise hota hai. nut i am thankfull to god that we meet , you fall in love with me , i reply to your msgs  nd slowly i too fall in love with you.

Personal photo sohan :- "i love you" means that i accept you for who you are, all your insecurities; what you see as imperfections and i see simply as parts of you that make you yourself. it means that i won't try to change you into someone different, it means that i will always care for you and be there for you no matter what comes in between us. 😌it means i'll stand by you and love you through the worst of times. That means loving you in a bad mood, when you're down, it means loving you and supporting you when you're too tired to do the things i want to do. it means me putting you before myself or anyone else. it means loving you all of the time. "i love you" means you can tell me anything if you ever want to and i'll always listen and never judge you. 💕all ask in return is that you don't judge me for the things i tell you. it means that i care enough to fight for you and hold you and never let go. it means i'm always thinking of you, dreaming of you, wishing could be with you when i'm not. "i love you" to me, is the connection between two people's hearts, beauty, personalities, and soul. it means we are intertwined into each others paths. it means that i'm not only in "this" for a sexual way, or a physical way. i'm in "this" [relationship] for all of you, everything you do and feel. it means there's a deeper connection that anyone else wouldn't be able to comprehend. it means always needing you or wanting you, knowing that you feel the same way towards me and trusting you to feel similarly. there is more to "ilove you" than i can describe in words other than the words i'm describing, "i love you".

Couple photo :- Having you in my life is having "sukoon" so
please stay forever.🥺

Aemno full smiling photo :- स्त्रीयों की तरह पुरुष का सौन्दर्य वर्णन नहीं किया गया.
