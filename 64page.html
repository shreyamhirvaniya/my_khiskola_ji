    <h1>'He literally doesn't know how<BR>
beautiful he is in my eyes,<BR>
He thinks he is an average guy little does he know<BR>
how special he is in my eyes, ☺️I can stare at him all<BR>
night all day without getting tired his eyelashes are so<BR>
pretty and his eyes are even prettier I love his hair so<BR>
much I want to play with them every time I see them<BR>
and his cheeks are so cute I want to caress them for<BR>
the rest of my life. I don't know why but his nose<BR>
reminds me that he is literally the cutest boy I have<BR>
ever seen in my life 😍and ohh those lips I never knew<BR>
someone's lips could look pretty until I saw him and I<BR>
wish to be kissed by those and those lips ONLY and<BR>
there are so many more things of him I can describe<BR>
knowing how gorgeous he is but I guess i will keep it💕<BR>
to myself as I only want him to mine for a longggggg time 🕰'
