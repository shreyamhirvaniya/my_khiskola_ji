    <h1> you're the song stuck in my head,
 you're the book i always read📖,
 you're the words I leave unsaid📃,
 you're my choice until the end,
 you're the most perfect melody,
 you're the reason I feel jealousy😒,
 you're the only one😌,
 you're the reason I can't feel no more,
 you're the  one I can't ignore,
 you're my best choice everyday,😇💖
 you're the person I need to stay with,
you're exactly why I feel okay,
you're who I need today.🥺
